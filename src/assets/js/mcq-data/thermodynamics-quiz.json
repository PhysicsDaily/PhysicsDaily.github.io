    "question": "What is the first law of thermodynamics?",
    "options": [
      "Energy cannot be created or destroyed",
      "Entropy of a closed system never decreases", 
      "Heat flows from hot to cold objects",
      "Absolute zero is unattainable"
    ],
    "answer": "Energy cannot be created or destroyed",
    "solution": "The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. Mathematically: ΔU = Q - W"

    "question": "In an isothermal process, which quantity remains constant?",
    "options": [
      "Pressure",
      "Volume",
      "Temperature", 
      "Internal energy"
    ],
    "answer": "Temperature",
    "solution": "An isothermal process occurs at constant temperature. For an ideal gas, this means PV = constant."

      "25%",
      "33%",
      "75%", 
      "67%"
    ],
    "answer": "25%",
    "solution": "Carnot efficiency η = 1 - Tc/Th = 1 - 300/400 = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 = 25%"

      "Adiabatic",
      "Isochoric", 
      "Isobaric"
    ],
    "answer": "Isochoric",
    "solution": "In an isochoric (constant volume) process, W = ∫PdV = 0 since dV = 0. No work is done when volume doesn't change."

    "options": [
      "Increases",
      "Decreases",
      "Remains constant", 
      "Becomes zero"
    ],
    "answer": "Remains constant",
    "solution": "In a reversible adiabatic process, dS = dQ/T = 0 since dQ = 0. Therefore, entropy remains constant (isentropic process)."
