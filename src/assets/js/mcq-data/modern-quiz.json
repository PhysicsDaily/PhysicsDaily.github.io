      "λ = p/h", 
      "λ = h/mv"
    ],
    "answer": "λ = h/p",
    "solution": "The de Broglie wavelength is λ = h/p = h/(mv), where h is Planck's constant, p is momentum, m is mass, and v is velocity."

      "ΔxΔp = 0"
    ],
    "answer": "ΔxΔp ≥ h/2π",
    "solution": "Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ = h/2π. You cannot simultaneously know both position and momentum with perfect precision."

    "question": "What happens in photoelectric effect?",
    "options": [
      "Electrons absorb photons and gain energy",
      "Electrons are emitted from metal surface when light shines on it",
      "Photons split into electron-positron pairs", 
      "Light waves interfere with electrons"
    ],
    "answer": "Electrons are emitted from metal surface when light shines on it",
    "solution": "In the photoelectric effect, electrons are emitted from a metal surface when light of sufficient frequency (above threshold) shines on it. This demonstrated the particle nature of light."
