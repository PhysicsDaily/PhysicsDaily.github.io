## Key Concepts

This chapter explores the practical applications of Newton's laws in various scenarios including:

- Friction forces (static and kinetic)
- Circular motion and centripetal force
- Drag forces and terminal velocity
- Applications in everyday situations

## Conceptual Questions

### Question 1: Friction on an Incline
Why does a block on an inclined plane start to slide only after the angle exceeds a certain critical value? How is this related to the coefficient of static friction?

### Question 2: Circular Motion
When a car turns a corner on a flat road, what force provides the centripetal acceleration? What happens if this force is insufficient?

### Question 3: Terminal Velocity
Explain why a falling object eventually reaches a constant velocity (terminal velocity) even though gravity continues to act on it.

### Question 4: Banking of Roads
Why are curved roads often banked? How does banking help vehicles navigate turns at higher speeds?

### Question 5: Tension in Strings
When multiple masses are connected by strings and pulled, why is the tension different in each string segment? Explain using Newton's laws.

## Practice Problems

Coming soon: Interactive problems with step-by-step solutions will be added here.
