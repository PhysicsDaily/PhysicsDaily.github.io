hasMCQ: true
learningObjectives:
  - State Newton's three laws of motion in words and symbols.

  - Solve single-body dynamics problems that include friction, tension, and normal forces.
keyConcepts:
  - title: Newton's First Law
    description: Objects maintain constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.
  - title: Newton's Second Law
    description: The net force on an object equals its mass times its acceleration ($F = ma$).

## Why This Chapter Matters

Newton's laws let us translate observations about motion into quantitative predictions. Mastering the language of forces and free-body diagrams keeps your reasoning consistent across any mechanics problem.

## 1. Newton's First Law - Inertia

- An object at rest stays at rest unless a net external force acts on it.
- An object moving at constant velocity keeps that velocity unless a net external force acts.
- A net force of zero means the sum of forces along each axis is zero.

> **Tip:** When a problem states "moving at constant speed in a straight line," immediately set the net force to zero.

## 2. Newton's Second Law - Dynamics

When forces do not cancel, an object accelerates. The vector equation is $\vec{F}_{\text{net}} = m\vec{a}$.

### Component Form

1. Resolve each force into x- and y-components.
2. Apply $\sum F_x = m a_x$ and $\sum F_y = m a_y$.
3. Solve for the unknowns (acceleration, force magnitude, or angle).

### Worked Example

A 5 kg crate is pulled with a 20 N horizontal force while kinetic friction provides 6 N opposite the motion.

- Net force: $F_{\text{net}} = 20\,\text{N} - 6\,\text{N} = 14\,\text{N}$
- Acceleration: $a = F_{\text{net}}/m = 14 / 5 = 2.8\,\text{m/s}^2$

## 3. Newton's Third Law - Action/Reaction

- Forces come in pairs acting on different bodies.
- Third-law partners never act on the same body, so they never cancel in a free-body diagram.
- Identifying the partner force helps track where forces originate.

## Building Free-Body Diagrams

1. Isolate the object and draw a simple outline.
2. Mark all forces: weight, normal, tension, friction, thrust, drag, etc.
3. Indicate directions clearly; label magnitudes or variables.
4. Choose axes that match the motion (tilting axes along an incline often simplifies calculations).

### Common Force Models

- **Weight:** $\vec{W} = m\vec{g}$, always downward near Earth's surface.
- **Normal force:** Perpendicular contact force that prevents overlap of surfaces.
- **Tension:** Pulling force transmitted along a rope or cable, assumed uniform if the rope is massless.
- **Friction:** Opposes relative motion; kinetic friction $f_k = \mu_k N$, static friction $f_s \le \mu_s N$.

## Self-Check Questions

- What does a zero net force tell you about an object's acceleration?
- How do you decide whether friction should oppose motion or attempted motion?
- Why can't third-law pairs cancel in a free-body diagram?
