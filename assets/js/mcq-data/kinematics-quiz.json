    {
      "question": "A body is said to be in motion if it changes its position with respect to:",
      "options": ["its own axis", "the observer", "time only", "its mass"],
      "answer": "the observer",
      "solution": "Motion is relative. An object's position must change relative to a reference point or observer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a vector quantity?",
      "options": ["Speed", "Distance", "Time", "Displacement"],
      "answer": "Displacement",
      "solution": "Displacement includes both magnitude (distance) and direction, making it a vector."
    },
    {
      "question": "The numerical ratio of displacement to distance for a moving object is:",
      "options": ["always less than 1", "always equal to 1", "always more than 1", "equal to or less than 1"],
      "answer": "equal to or less than 1",
      "solution": "Displacement is the shortest path, so its magnitude can never be greater than the actual distance traveled."
    },
    {
      "question": "A body moves in a full circle of radius <em>R</em>. What is the displacement after completing the circle?",
      "options": ["2π<em>R</em>", "<em>R</em>", "Zero", "π<em>R</em>"],
      "answer": "Zero",
      "solution": "The object ends at the same point it started, so its change in position (displacement) is zero."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a body is moving with a constant velocity, then its acceleration is:",
      "options": ["Non-zero and constant", "Infinite", "Variable", "Zero"],
      "answer": "Zero",
      "solution": "Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. If velocity is constant, its rate of change is zero."
    },
    {
      "question": "The slope of a velocity-time graph represents:",
      "options": ["Displacement", "Distance", "Acceleration", "Speed"],
      "answer": "Acceleration",
      "solution": "Slope is rise/run. For a v-t graph, this is Δv/Δt, which is the definition of acceleration."
    },
    {
      "question": "A body is thrown vertically upwards. At its highest point, which of the following is true?",
      "options": ["Its velocity is zero and its acceleration is also zero.", "Its velocity is zero and its acceleration is non-zero.", "Its velocity is non-zero and its acceleration is zero.", "Both velocity and acceleration are non-zero."],
      "answer": "Its velocity is zero and its acceleration is non-zero.",
      "solution": "At the peak, the object momentarily stops (v=0) before falling, but gravity is still accelerating it downwards (a=g)."
    },
    {
      "question": "The area under an acceleration-time graph represents the:",
      "options": ["Displacement", "Change in velocity", "Average velocity", "Final velocity"],
      "answer": "Change in velocity",
      "solution": "Since a = Δv/Δt, it follows that Δv = a * Δt. The area (height × width) represents this product."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following situations is impossible?",
      "options": ["An object has zero velocity but non-zero acceleration.", "An object has constant speed but varying velocity.", "An object has constant velocity but varying speed.", "An object has negative velocity and positive acceleration."],
      "answer": "An object has constant velocity but varying speed.",
      "solution": "Velocity includes speed. If velocity is constant, its magnitude (speed) must also be constant."
    },
    {
      "question": "If the velocity and acceleration of a particle have opposite signs, the speed of the particle:",
      "options": ["Increases", "Decreases", "Remains constant", "Is zero"],
      "answer": "Decreases",
      "solution": "When acceleration opposes velocity, the object slows down (decelerates)."
    },
    {
      "question": "The motion of a body under the influence of gravity alone is independent of its:",
      "options": ["Mass", "Height of fall", "Initial velocity", "Shape"],
      "answer": "Mass",
      "solution": "In the absence of air resistance, all objects fall with the same acceleration (g) regardless of their mass."
    },
    {
      "question": "For a body starting from rest and moving with uniform acceleration, the ratio of distances covered in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd seconds is:",
      "options": ["1:2:3", "1:4:9", "1:3:5", "1:1:1"],
      "answer": "1:3:5",
      "solution": "This is Galileo's law of odd numbers. The distance covered in the nth second is proportional to (2n-1)."
    },
    {
      "question": "The SI unit of acceleration is:",
      "options": ["m/s", "cm/s²", "m/s²", "km/h²"],
      "answer": "m/s²",
      "solution": "Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity (m/s) per second, hence m/s²."
    },
    {
      "question": "When can the average velocity of a moving object be zero over a time interval?",
      "options": ["When the average speed is zero.", "When the total distance covered is zero.", "When the final position is the same as the initial position.", "Only if the object remains at rest."],
      "answer": "When the final position is the same as the initial position.",
      "solution": "Average velocity is displacement/time. If displacement is zero (starts and ends at the same point), average velocity is zero."
    },
    {
      "question": "If an object travels at a constant speed in a circular path, its velocity is:",
      "options": ["Constant", "Continuously changing", "Zero", "Infinite"],
      "answer": "Continuously changing",
      "solution": "Velocity is a vector. In circular motion, the direction of motion is always changing, so the velocity vector is continuously changing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which must be true for the magnitude of average velocity to be equal to the average speed?",
      "options": ["The object must be at rest.", "The object must move in a circle.", "The object must move on a straight path without changing direction.", "The object must have zero acceleration."],
      "answer": "The object must move on a straight path without changing direction.",
      "solution": "Only in this case is the magnitude of the displacement equal to the total distance traveled."
    },
    {
      "question": "A particle's position is given by <em>x</em> = 5. What is its velocity?",
      "options": ["5 m/s", "Cannot be determined", "Zero", "1 m/s"],
      "answer": "Zero",
      "solution": "Velocity is the rate of change of position. Since the position is constant, its rate of change is zero."
    },
    {
      "question": "Retardation is defined as:",
      "options": ["Negative velocity", "Negative acceleration", "Rate of change of position", "Positive acceleration"],
      "answer": "Negative acceleration",
      "solution": "Retardation, or deceleration, is an acceleration that opposes the direction of motion, often represented as negative acceleration."
    },
    {
      "question": "For a uniformly accelerated motion, the average velocity is given by:",
      "options": ["<em>v</em>", "<em>u</em>", "(<em>u</em>+<em>v</em>)/2", "(<em>v</em>-<em>u</em>)/2"],
      "answer": "(<em>u</em>+<em>v</em>)/2",
      "solution": "For constant acceleration, the average velocity is the arithmetic mean of the initial (u) and final (v) velocities."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a feather and a stone are dropped simultaneously in a vacuum from the same height, which one reaches the ground first?",
      "options": ["The feather", "The stone", "They reach at the same time", "Depends on their shape"],
      "answer": "They reach at the same time",
      "solution": "In a vacuum, there is no air resistance, so all objects fall with the same acceleration (g) and will reach the ground simultaneously."
