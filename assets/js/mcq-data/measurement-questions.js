        "question": "Which of the following is a fundamental unit in the SI system?",
        "options": [
            "Newton",
            "Joule",
            "Watt",
            "Kilogram"
        ],
        "answer": "Kilogram",
        "solution": "The SI system is based on seven fundamental units. The kilogram (mass) is one of them. Newton (force), Joule (energy), and Watt (power) are all derived units."

            "[MLT⁻²]",
            "[ML⁻¹T⁻²]",
            "[ML²T⁻²]",
            "[MT⁻²]"
        ],
        "answer": "[ML⁻¹T⁻²]",
        "solution": "Pressure is defined as Force per unit Area. The dimensions of Force are [MLT⁻²] and the dimensions of Area are [L²]. Therefore, the dimensions of Pressure are [MLT⁻²] / [L²] = [ML⁻¹T⁻²]."

        "question": "A measurement is stated as 1.23 x 10⁴ g. How many significant figures does it have?",
        "options": [
            "2",
            "3",
            "4",
            "5"
        ],
        "answer": "3",
        "solution": "In scientific notation (a x 10^b), all digits in the coefficient 'a' are significant. Here, the coefficient is 1.23, which has three digits. Therefore, the measurement has 3 significant figures."

            "10⁻⁹"
        ],
        "answer": "10⁹",
        "solution": "The SI prefix 'giga' (symbol G) represents a factor of 10⁹, which is one billion."

    {
        "question": "The density of a material is 8.0 g/cm³. What is its value in kg/m³?",
        "options": [
            "80",
            "800",
            "8000",
            "0.008"
        ],
        "answer": "8000",
        "solution": "To convert g/cm³ to kg/m³, we use the conversion factors: 1 kg = 1000 g and 1 m = 100 cm. So, 1 m³ = (100 cm)³ = 1,000,000 cm³. The conversion factor is (1 kg / 1000 g) * (1,000,000 cm³ / 1 m³) = 1000. Therefore, 8.0 g/cm³ * 1000 = 8000 kg/m³."
