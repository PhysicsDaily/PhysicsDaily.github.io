      "F = qvB"
    ],
    "answer": "F = k(q₁q₂)/r²",
    "solution": "Coulomb's law describes the electrostatic force between two point charges: F = k(q₁q₂)/r², where k = 8.99×10⁹ N⋅m²/C²"

    "question": "What is the SI unit of electric field?",
    "options": [
      "N/C",
      "V/m",
      "Both A and B", 
      "C/N"
    ],
    "answer": "Both A and B",
    "solution": "Electric field can be expressed as force per unit charge (N/C) or as voltage gradient (V/m). Since 1 V = 1 J/C = 1 N⋅m/C, both units are equivalent."

      "Magnetic flux",
      "Rate of change of magnetic flux",
      "Electric field", 
      "Current"
    ],
    "answer": "Rate of change of magnetic flux",
    "solution": "Faraday's law states that EMF = -dΦ/dt, where Φ is magnetic flux. The EMF is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux."

    "options": [
      "Parallel to velocity",
      "Parallel to magnetic field",
      "Perpendicular to both velocity and magnetic field", 
      "Opposite to velocity"
    ],
    "answer": "Perpendicular to both velocity and magnetic field",
    "solution": "The magnetic force F = q(v × B) is perpendicular to both the velocity vector and magnetic field vector, following the right-hand rule."
