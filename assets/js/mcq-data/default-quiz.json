    "question": "What is the fundamental unit of length in the SI system?",
    "options": [
      "Centimeter",
      "Meter", 
      "Kilometer",
      "Millimeter"
    ],
    "answer": "Meter",
    "solution": "The meter (m) is the SI base unit for length. All other length units are derived from the meter."

    "question": "Which of the following is a vector quantity?",
    "options": [
      "Speed",
      "Distance",
      "Velocity", 
      "Time"
    ],
    "answer": "Velocity",
    "solution": "Velocity is a vector quantity because it has both magnitude and direction. Speed, distance, and time are scalar quantities."

    "question": "What is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth's surface?",
    "options": [
      "9.8 m/s²",
      "10 m/s²",
      "8.9 m/s²", 
      "11 m/s²"
    ],
    "answer": "9.8 m/s²",
    "solution": "The standard acceleration due to gravity on Earth's surface is approximately 9.8 m/s² or 9.81 m/s²."

    "question": "In physics, work is defined as:",
    "options": [
      "Force × Time",
      "Force × Distance", 
      "Mass × Velocity",
      "Force × Velocity"
    ],
    "answer": "Force × Distance",
    "solution": "Work is defined as W = F·d cos θ, where F is force, d is displacement, and θ is the angle between force and displacement vectors."

  {
    "question": "What is the unit of energy in the SI system?",
    "options": [
      "Watt",
      "Newton",
      "Joule", 
      "Pascal"
    ],
    "answer": "Joule",
    "solution": "The joule (J) is the SI unit of energy. It equals one newton-meter (N·m) or one watt-second (W·s)."
