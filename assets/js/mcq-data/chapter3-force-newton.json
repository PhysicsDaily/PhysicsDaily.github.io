    "question": "What is Newton's First Law of Motion?",
    "options": [
      "F = ma",
      "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction",
      "An object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force",
      "Energy cannot be created or destroyed"
    ],
    "answer": "An object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force",
    "solution": "Newton's First Law, also known as the Law of Inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force."

    "question": "If a 5 kg object experiences a net force of 20 N, what is its acceleration?",
    "options": [
      "4 m/s²",
      "25 m/s²",
      "100 m/s²",
      "0.25 m/s²"
    ],
    "answer": "4 m/s²",
    "solution": "Using Newton's Second Law: F = ma, therefore a = F/m = 20 N / 5 kg = 4 m/s²"

    "question": "Which of the following is an example of Newton's Third Law?",
    "options": [
      "A ball rolling down a hill",
      "A rocket propelling forward by expelling gas backward",
      "An object falling due to gravity",
      "A car maintaining constant velocity"
    ],
    "answer": "A rocket propelling forward by expelling gas backward",
    "solution": "Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The rocket pushes gas backward (action), and the gas pushes the rocket forward (reaction)."

      "Kilogram",
      "Newton",
      "Joule",
      "Pascal"
    ],
    "answer": "Newton",
    "solution": "The SI unit of force is the Newton (N), defined as kg⋅m/s². One Newton is the force required to accelerate a 1 kg mass at 1 m/s²."

      "Zero velocity",
      "Zero acceleration",
      "Zero mass",
      "Zero momentum"
    ],
    "answer": "Zero acceleration",
    "solution": "An object in equilibrium has zero net force acting on it, which means zero acceleration. It can still have constant velocity (including zero velocity)."
