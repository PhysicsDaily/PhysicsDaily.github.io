## Key Equations Preview

!!! info "Fundamental Equations"
    **Kinematics:**
    $$v = v_0 + at \qquad x = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$

    **Newton's Second Law:**
    $$\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$$

    **Work-Energy Theorem:**
    $$W_{net} = \Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$$

    **Conservation of Energy:**
    $$K_1 + U_1 + W_{other} = K_2 + U_2$$
