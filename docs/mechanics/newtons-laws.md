## The Three Laws

!!! abstract "Newton's Laws"
    **First Law:** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net force.
    
    **Second Law:** $$\vec{F}_{net} = m\vec{a}$$
    
    **Third Law:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
    $$\vec{F}_{A \text{ on } B} = -\vec{F}_{B \text{ on } A}$$
