## Features

!!! tip "Interactive Learning"
    - 📐 **Mathematical rigor** with full LaTeX equation support
    - 🎯 **Practice problems** and worked examples
    - 🧪 **Interactive simulations** for key concepts
    - ✅ **MCQs** for self-assessment

!!! example "Sample Equation"
    The famous mass-energy equivalence:
    
    $$E = mc^2$$
    
    Where $E$ is energy, $m$ is mass, and $c$ is the speed of light.
