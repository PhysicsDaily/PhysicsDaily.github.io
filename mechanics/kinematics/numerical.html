                            <p><strong>Wait!</strong> A negative height means they collide below the ground, which is impossible. Let's re-check.

Let's assume the building is shorter. If the building was 50m high: 20t = 50, so t=2.5s. y1(2.5) = 20(2.5) - 4.9(2.5)^2 = 50 - 30.6 = 19.4m. The original problem as stated has no mid-air collision. Let's solve as intended: they collide at t=5.0s, which means the thrown ball has already hit the ground and is at y=0, while the dropped ball is at y=100-4.9(25) = -22.5m. The premise is flawed, but the mathematical answer for when their y-equations are equal is 5.0s.</p>
