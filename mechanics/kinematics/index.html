    <h2>üåü Introduction: Understanding Motion</h2>
    
    <div class="beginner-note">
        <h4>üî∞ For Beginners:</h4>
        <p>Think about your daily life - walking to school, riding a bike, or watching a ball fall. All of these involve motion! Kinematics is the branch of physics that describes motion mathematically, helping us predict where objects will be and when they'll get there.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Kinematics is the mathematical description of motion.</strong> It answers fundamental questions: Where is an object? How fast is it moving? Is it speeding up or slowing down? These seemingly simple questions form the foundation for understanding everything from planetary orbits to quantum mechanics.</p>

    <p>The beauty of kinematics lies in its universality. The same equations that describe a falling apple also govern the motion of satellites, the oscillation of atoms, and the expansion of the universe. By mastering one-dimensional motion, you're building the conceptual framework needed for all of physics.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h4>Real-World Applications</h4>
        <p>Kinematics isn't just academic - it's everywhere! Engineers use kinematic equations to design safe cars and efficient rockets. Sports analysts apply these concepts to optimize athlete performance. Even your smartphone's accelerometer uses kinematic principles to detect orientation and motion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="advanced-note">
        <h4>üéì Historical Context:</h4>
        <p>Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was the first to mathematically describe motion, laying the groundwork for Newton's laws. His studies of falling objects and projectile motion established the foundation of modern kinematics and challenged Aristotelian physics that had dominated for centuries.</p>

    <h2>2.1 Physical Quantities: Scalars and Vectors</h2>
    
    <div class="beginner-note">
        <h4>üî∞ Simple Analogy:</h4>
        <p>Imagine giving directions to a friend. Saying "walk 5 blocks" isn't enough - they need to know which direction! Speed tells you how fast, but velocity tells you how fast AND which way. That's the difference between scalars and vectors.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Defining Physical Quantities</h3>
    <p>In physics, we classify all measurable properties into two fundamental categories based on the information they contain:</p>

    <h4>Scalar Quantities</h4>
    <p><strong>Scalars</strong> are completely described by magnitude alone - just a number with units. They tell us "how much" but not "which direction."</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>üìù Scalar Examples in Motion:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> "I walked 5 kilometers" (total path length)</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> "The car travels at 60 mph" (rate of motion)</li>
            <li><strong>Time:</strong> "The journey took 3 hours" (duration)</li>
            <li><strong>Mass:</strong> "The object weighs 2 kg" (amount of matter)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Vector Quantities</h4>
    <p><strong>Vectors</strong> require both magnitude and direction for complete description. They tell us "how much" AND "which way."</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>üìù Vector Examples in Motion:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> "5 km northeast from the starting point" (change in position)</li>
            <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> "60 mph due north" (rate of change of position)</li>
            <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong> "Slowing down at 2 m/s¬≤ eastward" (rate of change of velocity)</li>
            <li><strong>Force:</strong> "10 N upward" (push or pull)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>2.2 Position, Displacement, and Distance</h2>
    
    <div class="beginner-note">
        <h4>üî∞ Think of it this way:</h4>
        <p>Position is like your address - it tells you exactly where you are. Displacement is like the straight-line path between your start and end points. Distance is like your odometer reading - the total path you actually traveled.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Position (x)</h3>
    <p><strong>Position</strong> specifies the location of an object relative to a chosen reference point (origin). In one dimension, position is measured along a single axis, typically the x-axis.</p>

    <div class="important-formula">
        <h4>Position Vector:</h4>
        <p><strong>x(t)</strong> = position at time t</p>
        <p>Units: meters (m), feet (ft), or any unit of length</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Displacement (Œîx)</h3>
    <p><strong>Displacement</strong> is the change in position - a vector quantity that points from the initial position to the final position, regardless of the actual path taken.</p>

    <div class="important-formula">
        <h4>Displacement Formula:</h4>
        <p><strong>Œîx = x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ</strong></p>
        <p>Where x‚ÇÅ = initial position, x‚ÇÇ = final position</p>
        <p>Note: Œî (delta) always means "change in"</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Distance (d)</h3>
    <p><strong>Distance</strong> is the total length of path traveled - a scalar quantity that's always positive.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h4>üìù Example: Walking Around the Block</h4>
        <p>You start at home (position x = 0), walk 3 blocks east (x = +3), then 4 blocks west to the store (x = -1).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initial position:</strong> x‚ÇÅ = 0 blocks</li>
            <li><strong>Final position:</strong> x‚ÇÇ = -1 block</li>
            <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> Œîx = (-1) - (0) = -1 block (1 block west)</li>
            <li><strong>Distance traveled:</strong> d = 3 + 4 = 7 blocks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notice: You traveled 7 blocks total, but you're only 1 block west of where you started!</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>2.3 Speed and Velocity</h2>
    
    <div class="beginner-note">
        <h4>üî∞ Car Dashboard Analogy:</h4>
        <p>Your speedometer shows speed (how fast you're going), but it doesn't tell you if you're heading toward your destination or away from it. Velocity includes both speed AND direction - it's like having GPS that shows your speed AND which way you're pointing!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Average Speed</h3>
    <p><strong>Average speed</strong> is the total distance traveled divided by the time taken - always positive.</p>

    <div class="important-formula">
        <h4>Average Speed:</h4>
        <p><strong>vÃÑ = total distance / total time = d / Œît</strong></p>
        <p>Units: m/s, mph, km/h</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Average Velocity</h3>
    <p><strong>Average velocity</strong> is the displacement divided by the time taken - can be positive or negative.</p>

    <div class="important-formula">
        <h4>Average Velocity:</h4>
        <p><strong>vÃÑ = Œîx / Œît = (x‚ÇÇ - x‚ÇÅ) / (t‚ÇÇ - t‚ÇÅ)</strong></p>
        <p>Units: m/s, with direction indicated by sign</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Instantaneous Velocity</h3>
    <p><strong>Instantaneous velocity</strong> is the velocity at a specific instant in time - the limit of average velocity as the time interval approaches zero.</p>

    <div class="important-formula">
        <h4>Instantaneous Velocity (Calculus):</h4>
        <p><strong>v(t) = lim(Œît‚Üí0) Œîx/Œît = dx/dt</strong></p>
        <p>This is the derivative of position with respect to time</p>
    </div>
