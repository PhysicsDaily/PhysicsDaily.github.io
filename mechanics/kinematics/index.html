                <div class="beginner-note">
                    <h4>🔰 For Beginners:</h4>
                    <p>Think about your daily life - walking to school, riding a bike, or watching a ball fall. All of these involve motion! Kinematics is the branch of physics that describes motion mathematically, helping us predict where objects will be and when they'll get there.</p>
                </div>

                <p><strong>Kinematics is the mathematical description of motion.</strong> It answers fundamental questions: Where is an object? How fast is it moving? Is it speeding up or slowing down? These seemingly simple questions form the foundation for understanding everything from planetary orbits to quantum mechanics.</p>

                <p>The beauty of kinematics lies in its universality. The same equations that describe a falling apple also govern the motion of satellites, the oscillation of atoms, and the expansion of the universe. By mastering one-dimensional motion, you're building the conceptual framework needed for all of physics.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Real-World Applications</h4>
                    <p>Kinematics isn't just academic - it's everywhere! Engineers use kinematic equations to design safe cars and efficient rockets. Sports analysts apply these concepts to optimize athlete performance. Even your smartphone's accelerometer uses kinematic principles to detect orientation and motion.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="advanced-note">
                    <h4>🎓 Historical Context:</h4>
                    <p>Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was the first to mathematically describe motion, laying the groundwork for Newton's laws. His studies of falling objects and projectile motion established the foundation of modern kinematics and challenged Aristotelian physics that had dominated for centuries.</p>

                <h2>2.1 Physical Quantities: Scalars and Vectors</h2>
                
                <div class="beginner-note">
                    <h4>🔰 Simple Analogy:</h4>
                    <p>Imagine giving directions to a friend. Saying "walk 5 blocks" isn't enough - they need to know which direction! Speed tells you how fast, but velocity tells you how fast AND which way. That's the difference between scalars and vectors.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Defining Physical Quantities</h3>
                <p>In physics, we classify all measurable properties into two fundamental categories based on the information they contain:</p>

                <h4>Scalar Quantities</h4>
                <p><strong>Scalars</strong> are completely described by magnitude alone - just a number with units. They tell us "how much" but not "which direction."</p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>📝 Scalar Examples in Motion:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Distance:</strong> "I walked 5 kilometers" (total path length)</li>
                        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> "The car travels at 60 mph" (rate of motion)</li>
                        <li><strong>Time:</strong> "The journey took 3 hours" (duration)</li>
                        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> "The object weighs 2 kg" (amount of matter)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4>Vector Quantities</h4>
                <p><strong>Vectors</strong> require both magnitude and direction for complete description. They tell us "how much" AND "which way."</p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>📝 Vector Examples in Motion:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> "I moved 3 km north" (change in position)</li>
                        <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> "The car travels at 60 mph eastward" (rate and direction of motion)</li>
                        <li><strong>Acceleration:</strong> "The object accelerates at 5 m/s² downward" (rate of velocity change)</li>
                        <li><strong>Force:</strong> "Apply 10 N upward" (push or pull with direction)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Mathematical Representation of Vectors</h3>
                <p>In one dimension, vectors are represented using positive and negative signs to indicate direction:</p>

                <div class="formula-box">
                    <h4>1D Vector Convention:</h4>
                    <p>Choose a coordinate system: Positive direction → (+)</p>
                    <p>Opposite direction → (−)</p>
                    <p>Example: +5 m/s (rightward), −3 m/s (leftward)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="advanced-note">
                    <h4>🎓 Vector Notation:</h4>
                    <p>Vectors are denoted with arrows (⃗v) or bold letters (v). The magnitude is written as |v| or simply v. In higher dimensions, vectors become more complex, but the one-dimensional case builds essential intuition.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Why the Distinction Matters</h3>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p><strong>Critical Insight:</strong> Scalar and vector quantities behave differently in calculations. You can't simply add speeds to get velocity, or masses to get acceleration. Understanding this distinction prevents common physics errors and builds deeper conceptual understanding.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>2.2 Position, Displacement, and Distance</h2>
                
                <div class="beginner-note">
                    <h4>🔰 Everyday Example:</h4>
                    <p>You start at home, walk to the grocery store, then to the bank, and finally back home. Your total distance traveled might be 2 miles, but your displacement is zero because you ended where you started!</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Position: Where Are You?</h3>
                <p><strong>Position</strong> specifies the location of an object relative to a chosen origin (reference point). In one dimension, position is a coordinate on a line.</p>

                <div class="formula-box">
                    <h4>Position Vector:</h4>
                    <p>x(t) = position at time t</p>
                    <p>Origin: x = 0 (reference point)</p>
                    <p>Positive direction: conventionally chosen</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Displacement: How Did You Move?</h3>
                <p><strong>Displacement (Δx)</strong> is the change in position - the straight-line distance from initial to final position, including direction.</p>

                <div class="formula-box">
                    <h4>Displacement Formula:</h4>
                    <p>Δx = x_f - x_i</p>
                    <p>where x_f = final position, x_i = initial position</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>📝 Displacement Examples:</h4>
                    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Move from x = 2 m to x = 8 m</p>
                    <p>Δx = 8 m - 2 m = +6 m (positive direction)</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Move from x = 5 m to x = 1 m</p>
                    <p>Δx = 1 m - 5 m = -4 m (negative direction)</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Move from x = 3 m to x = 7 m, then back to x = 3 m</p>
                    <p>Net displacement: Δx = 3 m - 3 m = 0 m</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Distance: How Far Did You Travel?</h3>
                <p><strong>Distance</strong> is the total length of the path traveled, regardless of direction. It's always positive and never decreases.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Key Differences: Displacement vs. Distance</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> Vector (has direction), can be positive, negative, or zero</li>
                        <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Scalar (no direction), always positive or zero</li>
                        <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> Straight-line path from start to finish</li>
                        <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Total path length actually traveled</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>📝 Comprehensive Example: Road Trip</h4>
                    <p>A car starts at position x = 0 km on a highway:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Drives 50 km east to position x = +50 km</li>
                        <li>Continues 30 km east to position x = +80 km</li>
                        <li>Turns around and drives 60 km west to position x = +20 km</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Final displacement:</strong> Δx = 20 km - 0 km = +20 km east</p>
                    <p><strong>Total distance:</strong> 50 km + 30 km + 60 km = 140 km</p>
                    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The car ends 20 km east of its starting point, but traveled 140 km total.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="advanced-note">
                    <h4>🎓 Mathematical Insight:</h4>
                    <p>For any motion, |displacement| ≤ distance. Equality holds only for straight-line motion in one direction. This relationship becomes crucial in optimization problems and provides insight into the efficiency of different paths.</p>

                <h2>2.3 Velocity: Rate of Change of Position</h2>
                
                <div class="beginner-note">
                    <h4>🔰 Intuitive Understanding:</h4>
                    <p>Velocity is like the "rate of change" of your location. If you're walking quickly, your position changes rapidly. If you're standing still, your position doesn't change at all - zero velocity!</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Average Velocity: The Big Picture</h3>
                <p><strong>Average velocity</strong> describes the overall rate of change of position over a time interval. It depends only on the initial and final positions, not on the details of the motion.</p>

                <div class="formula-box">
                    <h4>Average Velocity:</h4>
                    <p>v̄ = Δx/Δt = (x_f - x_i)/(t_f - t_i)</p>
                    <p>Units: meters per second (m/s)</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h4>📝 Average Velocity Example:</h4>
                    <p>A runner starts at position x = 0 m at t = 0 s and reaches position x = 100 m at t = 20 s.</p>
                    <p>v̄ = (100 m - 0 m)/(20 s - 0 s) = 100 m/20 s = 5 m/s</p>
                    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> On average, the runner moved 5 meters east every second.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Instantaneous Velocity: The Precise Moment</h3>
                <p><strong>Instantaneous velocity</strong> is the velocity at a specific instant in time. It's the limit of average velocity as the time interval approaches zero.</p>

                <div class="formula-box">
                    <h4>Instantaneous Velocity:</h4>
                    <p>v(t) = lim(Δt→0) Δx/Δt = dx/dt</p>
                    <p>This is the derivative of position with respect to time</p>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Graphical Interpretation</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Average velocity:</strong> Slope of secant line connecting two points on position vs. time graph</li>
                        <li><strong>Instantaneous velocity:</strong> Slope of tangent line at a specific point on position vs. time graph</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>🔰 Feeling Acceleration:</h4>
                    <p>You experience acceleration every day! When a car starts moving, you feel pushed back into your seat. When it brakes, you feel thrown forward. When an elevator starts going up, you feel heavier. These sensations are your body detecting changes in velocity - acceleration!</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Understanding Acceleration</h3>
                <p><strong>Acceleration</strong> describes how quickly velocity changes. Like velocity, it's a vector quantity with both magnitude and direction. Acceleration can involve changes in speed, direction, or both.</p>

                <h3>Average Acceleration</h3>
                <p><strong>Average acceleration</strong> is the change in velocity divided by the time interval over which the change occurs.</p>

                    <p>A bike slows from 15 m/s to 5 m/s in 4 seconds.</p>
                    <p>ā = (5 m/s - 15 m/s)/(4 s) = -10 m/s / 4 s = -2.5 m/s²</p>

                    <strong>1.</strong> Can an object have zero velocity but non-zero acceleration? Provide a specific example and explain the physics involved.
                    <details>
                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <p>Yes! At the highest point of a ball thrown vertically upward, the velocity is momentarily zero, but acceleration is still -9.8 m/s² downward due to gravity. The velocity is zero because the upward motion has stopped, but acceleration continues to act, causing the ball to begin falling. This demonstrates that acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, not velocity itself.</p>

                    <strong>2.</strong> Explain why the area under a velocity-time graph gives displacement. What does the area under an acceleration-time graph represent?
                    <details>
                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <p>The area under a velocity-time graph gives displacement because displacement is the integral of velocity over time: Δx = ∫v dt. Graphically, this integral represents the area between the curve and the time axis. Similarly, the area under an acceleration-time graph gives the change in velocity: Δv = ∫a dt. This relationship comes from the fundamental theorem of calculus connecting derivatives and integrals.</p>

                    <strong>3.</strong> Two cars start from rest and travel the same distance. Car A accelerates for half the time then coasts at constant velocity. Car B accelerates uniformly throughout. Which car has the higher final velocity and why?
                    <details>
                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <p>Car B (uniform acceleration) has the higher final velocity. For the same distance, Car A must have a higher average velocity during its acceleration phase to compensate for the coasting phase. However, this requires Car A to reach a higher peak velocity early, then maintain it. Car B's steady acceleration results in a higher final velocity. This can be proven by comparing the kinematic equations for both scenarios.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <strong>4.</strong> Is it possible for an object to have a northward velocity and a southward acceleration simultaneously? What would this motion look like?
                    <details>
                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <p>Yes, this is possible and common. The object would be moving northward but slowing down due to southward acceleration. Examples include: a car braking while traveling north, a ball thrown northward that's slowing due to air resistance, or a rocket traveling north with engines firing southward. The object continues northward until its velocity reaches zero, then begins moving southward if acceleration continues.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <strong>5.</strong> Why do all objects fall at the same rate in vacuum, regardless of their mass? How does this relate to Newton's second law?
                    <details>
                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <p>In Newton's second law, F = ma, the gravitational force is proportional to mass (F = mg), so a = mg/m = g. The mass cancels out, leaving acceleration independent of mass. This occurs because gravitational mass (which determines force) equals inertial mass (which resists acceleration). This equivalence, known as the equivalence principle, was crucial to Einstein's development of general relativity.</p>

                    <strong>6.</strong> Explain the difference between average velocity and average speed. Under what conditions are they equal?
                    <details>
                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <p>Average velocity = displacement/time (vector), while average speed = distance/time (scalar). They are equal only when motion is in a single direction without changing direction. If an object changes direction, the distance traveled exceeds the displacement magnitude, making average speed greater than average velocity magnitude. For round trips, average velocity is zero while average speed is positive.</p>

                    <strong>7.</strong> How would the kinematic equations change on a planet with different gravitational acceleration? Would the mathematical relationships remain valid?
                    <details>
                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <p>The kinematic equations themselves remain unchanged because they're derived from the mathematical definitions of velocity and acceleration. Only the value substituted for 'a' changes. On Mars (g ≈ 3.7 m/s²), objects fall more slowly, but the equations v = v₀ + at still apply with a = -3.7 m/s². The mathematical relationships are universal; only the physical parameters change.</p>

                    <strong>8.</strong> Can you have constant speed with changing velocity? Provide an example and explain why this occurs.
                    <details>
                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <p>Yes! Circular motion at constant speed involves changing velocity because velocity is a vector (has direction). A car moving around a circular track at 60 mph has constant speed but continuously changing velocity due to direction changes. This requires centripetal acceleration toward the center of the circle. Speed (scalar) remains constant while velocity (vector) changes continuously.</p>

                    <strong>9.</strong> If you drop a ball from a moving car, does it fall straight down relative to the ground? Explain using kinematic principles.
                    <details>
                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <p>No, relative to the ground, the ball follows a parabolic path. The ball inherits the car's horizontal velocity when dropped and simultaneously experiences vertical acceleration due to gravity. From the car's reference frame, it falls straight down. From the ground's reference frame, it has both horizontal and vertical motion components. This demonstrates the principle of superposition in kinematics.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <strong>10.</strong> Explain why kinematic equations assume constant acceleration. What happens to these equations when acceleration varies with time?
                    <details>
                        <summary>Answer</summary>
                        <p>Kinematic equations assume constant acceleration because they're derived by integrating constant values. When acceleration varies with time, a(t), we must use calculus: v(t) = v₀ + ∫a(t)dt and x(t) = x₀ + ∫v(t)dt. The simple algebraic kinematic equations become invalid. Instead, we need differential equations or numerical methods to solve variable acceleration problems. This limitation makes these equations applicable primarily to idealized scenarios.</p>
