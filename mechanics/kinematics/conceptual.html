                    <strong>1. Can an object have zero velocity but non-zero acceleration? Provide a specific example and explain the physics involved.</strong>
                    <details>
                        <summary>View Answer</summary>
                        <p>Yes. The classic example is an object thrown vertically upward. At the very peak of its trajectory, its instantaneous velocity is zero as it changes direction from moving up to moving down. However, the acceleration due to gravity (<span class="math">g</span> ‚âà 9.8 m/s¬≤) is still acting on it, pulling it downward. Acceleration is the rate of *change* of velocity, and at that peak moment, the velocity is indeed changing (from positive to negative), even if its value is momentarily zero.</p>

                    <strong>2. Is it possible for an object to have a constant speed but a changing velocity? Explain.</strong>
                    <details>
                        <summary>View Answer</summary>
                        <p>Yes. This occurs when an object moves in a circular path at a constant speed (uniform circular motion). Speed is a scalar quantity (magnitude only), while velocity is a vector (magnitude and direction). In circular motion, the direction of the velocity vector is constantly changing (it's always tangent to the circle), even if its magnitude (the speed) remains the same. Since the velocity is changing, the object is accelerating (this is called centripetal acceleration).</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <strong>3. If the average velocity of an object over a certain time interval is zero, what can you say about its displacement over that interval? What can you say about its total distance traveled?</strong>
                    <details>
                        <summary>View Answer</summary>
                        <p>If the average velocity is zero, the displacement must also be zero. Average velocity is defined as displacement divided by time (<span class="math">&#x203E;v</span> = Œî<span class="math">x</span>/Œî<span class="math">t</span>). For this to be zero, the numerator (displacement) must be zero. This means the object ended up in the exact same position where it started. However, you cannot conclude that the total distance traveled is zero. The object could have moved away from its starting point and then returned, covering a non-zero distance (like running a lap around a track).</p>

                    <strong>4. A car and a truck start from rest and accelerate at the same rate. However, the car accelerates for twice the amount of time as the truck. Compare the distances traveled by the car and the truck.</strong>

                        <p>The car will travel four times the distance of the truck. The relevant kinematic equation is <span class="math">x = v‚ÇÄt + ¬Ωat¬≤</span>. Since both start from rest (<span class="math">v‚ÇÄ</span> = 0), the equation simplifies to <span class="math">x = ¬Ωat¬≤</span>. Distance is proportional to the square of time (<span class="math">x ‚àù t¬≤</span>). If the car accelerates for twice the time (<span class="math">2t</span>), the distance it travels will be proportional to <span class="math">(2t)¬≤ = 4t¬≤</span>. Therefore, it covers four times the distance.</p>

                    <strong>5. You drop a stone from a cliff. At the same instant, your friend throws another stone straight down from the same cliff with an initial velocity. Which stone has the greater acceleration just after release? Which stone hits the ground first?</strong>
                    <details>
                        <summary>View Answer</summary>
                        <p>Both stones have the exact same acceleration. Once they are in the air, the only force acting on them (neglecting air resistance) is gravity. Therefore, both accelerate downwards at <span class="math">g</span> ‚âà 9.8 m/s¬≤. The stone that was thrown downwards will hit the ground first because it starts with a higher initial velocity and will maintain a greater velocity throughout its entire fall compared to the dropped stone.</p>

                    <strong>6. A position-time graph for a particle is a straight line with a negative slope. What can you conclude about the particle's motion?</strong>
                    <details>
                        <summary>View Answer</summary>
                        <p>The particle is moving with a constant negative velocity. The slope of a position-time graph represents velocity. Since the slope is a constant (it's a straight line), the velocity is constant. Since the slope is negative, the velocity is in the negative direction. Because the velocity is constant, the acceleration is zero.</p>

                    <strong>7. Can the direction of an object's velocity be opposite to the direction of its acceleration? If so, describe such a motion.</strong>
                    <details>
                        <summary>View Answer</summary>
                        <p>Yes. This happens whenever an object is slowing down (decelerating). For example, if a car is moving to the right (positive velocity) but the driver applies the brakes, the acceleration is to the left (negative acceleration). Similarly, a ball thrown upward has an upward (positive) velocity but a downward (negative) acceleration due to gravity.</p>

                    <strong>8. Two objects are dropped from the same height, one second apart. As they fall, does the distance between them increase, decrease, or stay the same?</strong>
                    <details>
                        <summary>View Answer</summary>
                        <p>The distance between them increases. The first object dropped will always have a greater instantaneous velocity than the second object. Since the first object is always moving faster than the second, the gap between them will continuously widen as they fall.</p>
