        <strong>1. Can an object have zero velocity but non-zero acceleration? Provide a specific example and explain the physics involved.</strong>
        <details>
            <summary>View Answer</summary>
            <p>Yes. The classic example is an object thrown vertically upward. At the very peak of its trajectory, its instantaneous velocity is zero as it changes direction from moving up to moving down. However, the acceleration due to gravity (<span class="math">g</span> â‰ˆ 9.8 m/sÂ²) is still acting on it, pulling it downward. Acceleration is the rate of *change* of velocity, and at that peak moment, the velocity is indeed changing (from positive to negative), even if its value is momentarily zero.</p>

        <strong>2. Is it possible for an object to have a constant speed but a changing velocity? Explain.</strong>
        <details>
            <summary>View Answer</summary>
            <p>Yes. This occurs when an object moves in a circular path at a constant speed (uniform circular motion). Speed is a scalar quantity (magnitude only), while velocity is a vector (magnitude and direction). In circular motion, the direction of the velocity vector is constantly changing (it's always tangent to the circle), even if its magnitude (the speed) remains the same. Since the velocity is changing, the object is accelerating (this is called centripetal acceleration).</p>

        <strong>3. If the average velocity of an object over a certain time interval is zero, what can you say about its displacement over that interval? What can you say about its total distance traveled?</strong>
        <details>
            <summary>View Answer</summary>
            <p>If the average velocity is zero, the displacement must also be zero. Average velocity is defined as displacement divided by time (<span class="math">&#x203E;v</span> = Î”<span class="math">x</span>/Î”<span class="math">t</span>). For this to be zero, the numerator (displacement) must be zero. This means the object ended up in the exact same position where it started. However, you cannot conclude that the total distance traveled is zero. The object could have moved away from its starting point and then returned, covering a non-zero distance (like running a lap around a track).</p>

        <strong>4. A car and a truck start from rest and accelerate at the same rate. However, the car accelerates for twice the amount of time as the truck. Compare the distances traveled by the car and the truck.</strong>

            <p>Using the kinematic equation <span class="math">x = vâ‚€t + Â½atÂ²</span> with <span class="math">vâ‚€ = 0</span>, we get <span class="math">x = Â½atÂ²</span>. For the truck with time <span class="math">t</span>: <span class="math">x_truck = Â½atÂ²</span>. For the car with time <span class="math">2t</span>: <span class="math">x_car = Â½a(2t)Â² = Â½a(4tÂ²) = 4(Â½atÂ²) = 4x_truck</span>. The car travels four times the distance of the truck because distance is proportional to the square of time.</p>

        <strong>5. An object is thrown upward from ground level. When does it have the same speed on its way down as it had on its way up? Explain why this makes physical sense.</strong>
        <details>
            <summary>View Answer</summary>
            <p>The object has the same speed (magnitude) at the same heights above the ground. This is due to conservation of energy. When the object passes through a particular height on its way down, it has the same gravitational potential energy as when it passed through that height going up. Since the total mechanical energy is conserved (ignoring air resistance), the kinetic energy (and hence the speed) must be the same at corresponding heights. The velocity vectors have opposite directions, but the speeds are identical.</p>

        <strong>6. Two objects are dropped from the same height at the same time. One is thrown horizontally and the other is simply released. Which object hits the ground first? Why?</strong>
        <details>
            <summary>View Answer</summary>
            <p>Both objects hit the ground at the same time. The horizontal motion and vertical motion are independent of each other (a key principle in projectile motion). Both objects start with zero vertical velocity and fall under the same gravitational acceleration. The horizontal velocity of the thrown object doesn't affect how long it takes to fall vertically. This is one of Galileo's famous insights that challenged Aristotelian physics - it's the vertical motion alone that determines the time of flight.</p>
