## 1. Core Definitions
| Raw Fragment | Status | Corrected / Clarified Version | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------------|-------|
| "Physical quantity A number or set of numbers ... is called physical quantity." | ‚úèÔ∏è | A **physical quantity** is a property of a phenomenon, body, or substance that can be measured and expressed as a number times a unit. | Original phrasing grammatically broken. |
| Numerical magnitude definition | ‚úÖ | The numerical value (pure number) in a measurement is the **numerical magnitude** n. |  |
| Unit definition | ‚úèÔ∏è | A **unit** is an established reference standard for a physical quantity. | Removed repetition. |
| Relation: n inversely proportional to u | ‚úèÔ∏è | For the same physical quantity: n‚ÇÅu‚ÇÅ = n‚ÇÇu‚ÇÇ (product constant). | Provide proper mathematical basis. |
| Statement: "n < 1" line | üö© | Removed. | Meaningless in context. |
| Formula shown as `Inu = constant` | ‚úèÔ∏è | Corrected to n √ó u = constant. | Stray capital I removed. |

## 2. Fundamental vs Supplementary Quantities
| Raw Fragment | Status | Corrected / Clarified Version | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------------|-------|
| 7 SI base quantities list | ‚úÖ | Mass (kg), Length (m), Time (s), Electric current (A), Thermodynamic temperature (K), Amount of substance (mol), Luminous intensity (cd). | Already present in chapter. |
| "Two supplementary" (plane & solid angle) | ‚úèÔ∏è | Plane angle (radian, rad) and solid angle (steradian, sr) are **dimensionless derived quantities** (not SI base). | Modern SI: treated as dimensionless. |
| Incorrect dimensional symbols: Plane angle [MLT¬∞] | üö© | Removed. | Wrong dimension notation. |

## 3. Derived Quantity Unit Construction Examples
| Raw Fragment | Status | Corrected / Clarified Version | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------------|-------|

## 5. Homogeneity Principle & Applications
| Raw Fragment | Status | Corrected / Clarified Version | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------------|-------|
| Principle wording fragmented | ‚úèÔ∏è | Only quantities with the same dimensions may be added or subtracted; each term in a physically valid equation must share dimensions (principle of dimensional homogeneity). |  |
| Example s = ut + ¬Ω a t¬≤ | ‚úÖ | Already in chapter; consistent. |  |
| Incorrect equation s = ut + a t (raw) | ‚úÖ | Retained as incorrect example explanation. |  |

## 6. Unit Conversion via Dimensions

| Raw Fragment | Status | Corrected / Clarified Version | Notes |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------------|-------|

| Pendulum period derivation (typos) | ‚úèÔ∏è | t = k L^¬Ω g^(-¬Ω); k = 2œÄ (cannot be found dimensionally). |  |
| Centripetal force derivation | ‚úÖ | F ‚àù m v¬≤ r‚Åª¬π ‚Üí F = m v¬≤ / r |  |
| Newton gravitation derivation confusion | ‚úèÔ∏è | F = G m‚ÇÅ m‚ÇÇ / r¬≤ (G supplies needed dimensions). |  |
| Ohm's law derivation | ‚úÖ | V = IR (dimensional check consistent). |  |

## 8. Limitations of Dimensional Analysis (Already Added)
All five listed; match raw content + cleaned phrasing.

## 9. Missing / Not Needed
| Topic | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Relative density = specific gravity | Already in chapter implicitly; could add a one-line clarity if desired. |
| Gravitational constant G dimensions explicit | Add compact clarification (Not yet explicit). |
| Clarify difference between resolution vs precision | Could be future enhancement. |

## Cleaned Content Block (Ready for Integration if Needed)

### Dimensional Clarifications Addendum
- Gravitational Constant: G has dimensions [M‚Åª¬πL¬≥T‚Åª¬≤].
- Density: œÅ = m/V ‚Üí [œÅ] = [ML‚Åª¬≥].
- Strain types (linear, area, volume) are all dimensionless ratios.
- General unit conversion: n‚ÇÇ = n‚ÇÅ (M‚ÇÅ/M‚ÇÇ)^Œ± (L‚ÇÅ/L‚ÇÇ)^Œ≤ (T‚ÇÅ/T‚ÇÇ)^Œ≥.
- 1 N = 10‚Åµ dyn; 1 J = 10‚Å∑ erg.

### Sample Power Conversion (Corrected)
Given 1 W = 1 J/s.
Target system: mass = 100 g, length = 10 cm, time = 1 min.
Dimensions of power: [ML¬≤T‚Åª¬≥].
Conversion factor = (10¬≥/10¬≤)¬π √ó (10¬≤/10¬π)¬≤ √ó (1/60)‚Åª¬≥ = 10 √ó 100 √ó 60¬≥ = 2.16 √ó 10‚Å∏ (units of new system).

## Recommendation
Most of the raw note content is already covered in `index.html`. Only small clarifications (G, explicit density line, compact conversion formula) could be added in an "Addendum" box. Let me know if you want those inserted.

Prepared for integration. Reply with ‚Äúadd addendum‚Äù if you‚Äôd like me to patch the chapter with the small missing clarifications.
