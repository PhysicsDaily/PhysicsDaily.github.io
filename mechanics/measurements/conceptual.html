        <strong>1.</strong> What are the key characteristics that make a physical standard suitable for scientific measurement? Why are these characteristics essential for scientific progress?
        <details>
            <summary>Answer</summary>
            <p>A good physical standard must be: <strong>Accessible</strong> (reproducible worldwide), <strong>Invariable</strong> (unchanging over time and location), <strong>Precise</strong> (allows measurement to desired accuracy), and <strong>Reproducible</strong>. These are essential because science relies on verifying results. If standards varied, experiments in different labs or at different times would not be comparable, hindering scientific progress.</p>

    <div class="question">
        <strong>20.</strong> Two students measure the same resistance. Student A reports <span class="equation">(100 Â± 10) Î©</span>. Student B reports <span class="equation">(105 Â± 1) Î©</span>. If the true value is <span class="equation">106 Î©</span>, which student was more precise? Which was more accurate?
        <details>
            <summary>Answer</summary>
            <p><strong>Precision</strong> relates to the size of the uncertainty. Student B's uncertainty is <span class="equation">Â±1 Î©</span>, while Student A's is <span class="equation">Â±10 Î©</span>. Therefore, <strong>Student B was more precise</strong>.
            <br><strong>Accuracy</strong> relates to how close the result is to the true value. Student B's range (<span class="equation">104-106 Î©</span>) includes the true value. Student A's range (<span class="equation">90-110 Î©</span>) also includes the true value, but Student B's central value (105 Î©) is much closer to the true value (106 Î©) than Student A's (100 Î©). Therefore, <strong>Student B was also more accurate</strong>.</p>
