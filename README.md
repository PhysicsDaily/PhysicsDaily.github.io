## ▶️ Run locally (Windows PowerShell)

This site uses Jekyll (GitHub Pages). To render Liquid front matter correctly, run a local server:

1) Install Ruby + DevKit, then install Bundler:
	- https://rubyinstaller.org/
	- In PowerShell: `gem install bundler`

2) Install dependencies in the repo root:

```powershell
bundle install
```

3) Serve the site with GitHub Pages config:

```powershell
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:4000 — the YAML front matter will not be visible; pages will render with the Jekyll layouts/includes.

## 📖 How to Use

1. Visit the [live website](https://physicsdaily.github.io)
2. Browse topics by clicking on the subject cards
3. Use the navigation menu to jump between sections
4. Practice with the provided examples and problems
5. Reference the formula sheets for quick lookups
