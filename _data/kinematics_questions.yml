- question: "1. A body is said to be in motion if it changes its position with respect to:"
  options:
    - "its own axis"
    - "the observer"
    - "time only"
    - "its mass"
  answer: "the observer"
  solution: "Motion is relative. An object's position must change relative to a reference point or observer."

- question: "2. Which of the following is a vector quantity?"
  options:
    - "Speed"
    - "Distance"
    - "Time"
    - "Displacement"
  answer: "Displacement"
  solution: "Displacement includes both magnitude (distance) and direction, making it a vector."

- question: "3. The numerical ratio of displacement to distance for a moving object is:"
  options:
    - "always less than 1"
    - "always equal to 1"
    - "always more than 1"
    - "equal to or less than 1"
  answer: "equal to or less than 1"
  solution: "Displacement is the shortest path, so its magnitude can never be greater than the actual distance traveled."

- question: "4. A body moves in a full circle of radius <em>R</em>. What is the displacement after completing the circle?"
  options:
    - "2π<em>R</em>"
    - "<em>R</em>"
    - "Zero"
    - "π<em>R</em>"
  answer: "Zero"
  solution: "The object ends at the same point it started, so its change in position (displacement) is zero."

- question: "5. If a body is moving with a constant velocity, then its acceleration is:"
  options:
    - "Non-zero and constant"
    - "Infinite"
    - "Variable"
    - "Zero"
  answer: "Zero"
  solution: "Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. If velocity is constant, its rate of change is zero."

- question: "6. The slope of a velocity-time graph represents:"
  options:
    - "Displacement"
    - "Distance"
    - "Acceleration"
    - "Speed"
  answer: "Acceleration"
  solution: "Slope is rise/run. For a v-t graph, this is Δv/Δt, which is the definition of acceleration."

- question: "7. A body is thrown vertically upwards. At its highest point, which of the following is true?"
  options:
    - "Its velocity is zero and its acceleration is also zero."
    - "Its velocity is zero and its acceleration is non-zero."
    - "Its velocity is non-zero and its acceleration is zero."
    - "Both velocity and acceleration are non-zero."
  answer: "Its velocity is zero and its acceleration is non-zero."
  solution: "At the peak, the object momentarily stops (v=0) before falling, but gravity is still accelerating it downwards (a=g)."

- question: "8. The area under an acceleration-time graph represents the:"
  options:
    - "Displacement"
    - "Change in velocity"
    - "Average velocity"
    - "Final velocity"
  answer: "Change in velocity"
  solution: "Since a = Δv/Δt, it follows that Δv = a * Δt. The area (height × width) represents this product."

- question: "9. Which of the following situations is impossible?"
  options:
    - "An object has zero velocity but non-zero acceleration."
    - "An object has constant speed but varying velocity."
    - "An object has constant velocity but varying speed."
    - "An object has negative velocity and positive acceleration."
  answer: "An object has constant velocity but varying speed."
  solution: "Velocity includes speed. If velocity is constant, its magnitude (speed) must also be constant."

- question: "10. If the velocity and acceleration of a particle have opposite signs, the speed of the particle:"
  options:
    - "Increases"
    - "Decreases"
    - "Remains constant"
    - "Is zero"
  answer: "Decreases"
  solution: "When acceleration opposes velocity, the object slows down (decelerates)."
