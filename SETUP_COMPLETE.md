## 🚀 Next Steps - Deploy Your Site!

### Step 1: Commit and Push These Changes

```bash
# Stage all new files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions deployment workflow"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Monitor Deployment

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/PhysicsDaily/PhysicsDaily.github.io
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. You should see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
4. Wait for both "build" and "deploy" jobs to complete (1-2 minutes)
5. Green checkmark ✅ = Success!

### Step 3: Verify Live Site

Visit: https://physicsdaily.github.io/

Your site should be live! 🎉

## ⚙️ GitHub Pages Settings Verification

Make sure your GitHub Pages settings are correct:

1. Go to: https://github.com/PhysicsDaily/PhysicsDaily.github.io/settings/pages

2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Should be **"GitHub Actions"** ✅
   - NOT "Deploy from a branch"

3. If it's not set correctly:
   - Change Source to "GitHub Actions"
   - Save
   - Re-run the workflow

## 🔍 How to Check Everything is Working

### Before Pushing (Local Testing)

```bash
# Test build
npm run build

# Should complete without errors
# Check _site/ folder was created
ls _site

# Test locally
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

### After Pushing (Deployment Check)

1. **Actions Tab** - Check workflow status
   - URL: https://github.com/PhysicsDaily/PhysicsDaily.github.io/actions
   - Should see green checkmark ✅

2. **Live Site** - Verify deployment
   - URL: https://physicsdaily.github.io/
   - Should load without errors
   - Check console for any 404s

3. **Assets Check**
   - CSS should be loaded (page styled correctly)
   - JavaScript should work (leaderboard, auth, etc.)
   - Images should load

## 🎯 Your Deployment Workflow (From Now On)

### Every Time You Want to Deploy:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
# Edit files in src/, assets/, etc.

# 2. Test locally
npm start

# 3. Test build
npm run build

# 4. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"

# 5. Push to GitHub (auto-deploys!)
git push origin main

# 6. Wait 1-2 minutes
# 7. Check live site!
```

**That's it!** No manual deployment needed. GitHub Actions handles everything automatically! 🚀

## 📊 Deployment Timeline

After you push to `main`:

- **0-10 seconds**: GitHub detects push and triggers workflow
- **10-60 seconds**: Installing dependencies and building site
- **60-90 seconds**: Deploying to GitHub Pages
- **90-120 seconds**: Site is live! (CDN may take 2-3 more minutes to update globally)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Workflow fails with "command not found"

**Solution**: The workflow uses `npx @11ty/eleventy` which is correct ✅

### Issue: Site shows 404

**Solution**: 
1. Verify GitHub Pages source is "GitHub Actions"
2. Check workflow completed successfully
3. Wait 2-3 minutes and clear browser cache

### Issue: Assets not loading (CSS/JS 404)

**Solution**: 
1. Check `.eleventy.js` has: `eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("assets");`
2. Verify paths don't have double slashes
3. Rebuild and redeploy

### Issue: Changes not appearing

**Solution**:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check Actions tab - did deployment succeed?
3. Wait a few more minutes for CDN cache

## ✨ What Happens Next?

1. **Push your changes** to `main` branch
2. **GitHub Actions automatically**:
   - Checks out your code
   - Installs Node.js 20
   - Runs `npm ci` to install dependencies
   - Runs `npx @11ty/eleventy` to build your site
   - Uploads the `_site/` folder as an artifact
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages
3. **Your site is live** at https://physicsdaily.github.io/ 🎉

## 🎓 Pro Tips

1. **Always test locally first**: `npm run build && npm start`
2. **Check Actions tab** after every push to confirm success
3. **Use meaningful commit messages** to track changes
4. **Keep dependencies updated**: `npm update`
5. **Monitor build times** in Actions tab (should be 1-2 minutes)
